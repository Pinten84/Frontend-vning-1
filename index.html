        <h1>Swedish Chicken Stew (Kycklinggryta)</h1>

            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Season chicken chunks with salt and pepper, then brown them on all sides (about 5-6 minutes). Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same pot, add diced onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook for another 3-4 minutes until vegetables start to soften.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir well. Cook for 1 minute to remove raw flour taste.</li>
                <li>Gradually add chicken stock while stirring constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
                <li>Add bay leaves, thyme, paprika, and halved potatoes. Bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Return the browned chicken to the pot and reduce heat to low. Simmer covered for 25-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in heavy cream and simmer for an additional 5 minutes until sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
                <li>Remove bay leaves and garnish with fresh chopped parsley before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with crusty bread or lingonberry sauce on the side.</li>
            </ol>
